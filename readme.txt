Demo video included in zip. This simulation uses a base of SPH(smoothed particle hydrodynamics) in addition to inter-particle springs modeled
by Hooke's Law to roughly simulate two dimensional soft bodies. Soft bodies are deformable solids(pillows, cloth, etc.).
Just open up main.py and hit F5 to start the simulation!
