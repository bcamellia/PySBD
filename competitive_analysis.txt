	- Using springs between particles to roughly simulate soft bodies in python.
	- Anti - Not very accurate, bodies cannot be sliced/combined, collision detection bug
	- Pro - Fast, can drag objects with mouse

	- Basic implementation of SPH simulator, simple to understand
	- Anti - no soft body implementation
	- Pro - easy to compare my design to this one
