I am building a soft body dynamics simulator based on SPH, or smoothed-particle hydrodynamics. I
first developed a SPH simulator as a base class for the SBD simulator, and extended the class so that particle forces
included a spring force based on Hooke's Law. This model approximates phenomena such as jelly, cloth, mud, etc. Uses can change
simulation parameters such as viscosity, particle mass, etc. The simulation works because SPH models the Navier-Stokes
equations which accurately describe the behavior of fluid.
